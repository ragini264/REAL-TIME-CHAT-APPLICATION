DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT : The Real-Time Chat Application is a front-end and back-end integrated project that focuses on building a live chat platform where users can send and receive messages instantly. This task, part of the CODTECH internship, challenges developers to use WebSockets for real-time communication and a modern front-end framework such as React.js or Vue.js for a dynamic user experience.
The core idea of this project is to create a messaging interface similar to WhatsApp, Messenger, or Slack, where two or more users can interact without needing to refresh the page. The application should support message input, instant display of sent messages, and maintain a visible chat history.

Key Features to Include:

1. User Interface (UI):
Design a responsive chat interface where users can type, send, and view messages in real-time. This includes a message input box, a send button, and a scrolling message display area.
2. Real-Time Messaging:
Implement WebSockets to establish a constant connection between users and the server, enabling instant transmission and reception of messages without delay.
3. Message History:
Display a chat history showing all previous messages in chronological order. Ensure that the history remains visible when users send or receive new messages.
4. Responsive Design:
Make sure the chat UI works across various devices including mobile, tablet, and desktop using responsive CSS or frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
5. Framework Usage:
Use a front-end JavaScript framework like React.js or Vue.js to handle dynamic rendering, component management, and UI reactivity for better user interaction.

Deliverables:

A working real-time chat application with clean UI.
Source code using WebSockets for live communication.
Chat messages stored and displayed with proper timestamps.
Hosted project or GitHub repository link containing all files and README.
